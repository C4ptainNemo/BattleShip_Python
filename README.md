This is the classic board game Battleships running in the terminal. Programmed in Python. To play the game run Battleships.exe.  
The Battleship.exe is a single file package of the main file and its dependencies, built using PyInstaller.

It can also be played in a terminal by running the main.py script.  
Note: Requires installation of colorama for cross-platform ANSI color support, run "-m pip install colorama" in the terminal.
